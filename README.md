Multi-layer-perceptron
======================

To use the code, simply download multilayer_perceptron.py. mlp_example.py shows an example of using the algorithm on the popular XOR problem.  It is based on scikit's convention - http://scikit-learn.org/stable/. In fact, I pushed it as a pull-request to scikit's GitHub, and now it waits for the final review.

Please email me if you face issues or feel that some parts of the code are incorrect :).
